# Binary-Search
Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

This code will take input - size of array, elements of the array, key to be searched.

If the key is present, then it will give the index value on which the key is present, else it will give a message "Entered key is not present in the array."
